## Objective ##
This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict student outcomes, including academic success and dropout rates. By analyzing key factors such as attendance, grades, parental qualifications, and socioeconomic data, the model provided actionable insights to help educational institutions identify at-risk students early and support them effectively.


## Team Composition and Roles ##
This project was a collaborative effort between two team members, each bringing complementary skills to ensure a successful outcome:

### Mathari Pavani
Managed data preprocessing and feature engineering, ensuring the dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for modeling.
Designed and implemented machine learning models (Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors).
Created visualizations to interpret results and communicated key findings.

### Ruchith Chippari
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and relationships in the dataset.
Focused on hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation for optimal model accuracy.
Assisted in project documentation and presentation.


## Methods and Technologies Used: ##
**Programming Language:**  Python
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression (for interpretability) and K-Nearest Neighbors (for flexibility in multidimensional data analysis)
**Visualization Tools:** Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful data representation


## Process ##

**Dataset Preparation:**
  - Data was collected, cleaned, and encoded to handle missing values and categorical variables.
  - Features such as attendance rates, grades, and socioeconomic indicators were engineered to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities.
**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Key insights were derived from trends and correlations, such as the impact of parental education and attendance on student performance.
**Modeling and Evaluation:**
  - Logistic Regression was used to analyze feature importance and achieved an accuracy of 85%.
  - K-Nearest Neighbors provided robust classification with slightly lower accuracy but excelled in capturing subtle patterns.
**Visualization and Reporting:**
  - Graphs and dashboards highlighted key drivers of student outcomes, offering stakeholders an intuitive understanding of the results.
  - Results and Insights:

The models successfully identified at-risk students, enabling early intervention strategies.
Logistic Regression provided actionable insights into critical predictors, such as grades and attendance.
KNN offered a flexible approach to classify students based on complex interactions in the data.

## Conclusion: ##
Through effective collaboration, the team developed a robust system to predict student outcomes, showcasing the practical application of machine learning in education. This project demonstrated the importance of combining interpretability and flexibility in predictive modeling to address real-world challenges.
